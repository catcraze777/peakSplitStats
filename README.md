# peakSplitStats
A speedrunning timer for Peak, keeps track of total run time (both IGT and RT) and time for each individual biome segment. Saves past run times to a .json file locally to use for pace tracking. Features UI template objects for other modders that want to add their own info to the SplitStats UI.
